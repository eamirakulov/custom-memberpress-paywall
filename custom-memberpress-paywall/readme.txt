Custom MemberPress Paywall allows admins to set a customizable free view limit before the paywall activates and whitelist specific MemberPress Rule IDs to bypass restrictions.

== Description ==
This plugin extends MemberPress functionality by:
* Allowing administrators to set the **number of free views** before content is locked.
* Supporting **multiple Rule IDs**, enabling certain users to bypass the paywall.
* Ensuring **guest users are completely blocked** (only logged-in users get free views).
* Using **cookies to track free views securely**.
* Providing an easy-to-use **WordPress admin settings page** (`Settings â†’ MemberPress Paywall`).
* Avoiding modifications to core MemberPress files by leveraging hooks and filters.
